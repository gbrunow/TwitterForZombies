# TwitterForZombies
Application built during Ruby on Rails course "[Rails for Zombies 2](http://railsforzombiestwo.codeschool.com/)", [Code School](http://codeschool.com/)

**Hey you!** Be aware that the course uses **Rails 3**, if you install a newer version some things will have changed.
I've installed **Rails 4** and am doing just fine, though.
